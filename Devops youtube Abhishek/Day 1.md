## 🚀 Why DevOps?

DevOps emerged to solve problems in traditional software delivery models.

### ❌ Pre‑DevOps Challenges

* Long lead times (≈ 10 days from commit to production)
* Manual hand‑offs causing errors
* Limited post‑deployment visibility

### ✅ How DevOps Solves Them

* ⚙️ Automation
* 🧪 Quality assurance
* 📊 Monitoring & observability
* 🔁 Continuous testing

## 🧱 Core Pillars of DevOps

| Pillar        | Description                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| ⚙️ Automation | Repeatable provisioning, deployment, rollback |
| 🧪 Quality    | Code reviews, static analysis, test suites    |
| 📊 Monitoring | Metrics, logs, alerts                         |
| 🔁 Testing    | Unit, integration, performance testing        |

## 🏭 Traditional Software Delivery (Pre‑DevOps)

| Role                   | Responsibility          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Developer              | Writes and commits code |
| System Admin           | Provisions servers      |
| Build/Release Engineer | Deploys builds          |
| Tester                 | Validates application   |

**Result:** Multiple hand‑offs and long delivery cycles.
