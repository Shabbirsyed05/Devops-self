## 🤖 What is DevOps?
DevOps is a **culture and set of practices** that help organizations deliver software
**faster, more reliably, and with high quality**.

### Key Points
- DevOps is **not a single tool**
- It is a **way of working**
- Focuses on **faster and repeatable delivery of value**

---

## 🚀 Why DevOps?
DevOps was introduced to solve issues in traditional, manual, and siloed software delivery models.

### ❌ Problems Before DevOps
- Long lead times (≈ 10 days from code commit to production)
- Manual hand-offs causing errors
- Low visibility after deployment

### ✅ How DevOps Solves Them
1. **Automation** – reduces manual effort  
2. **Quality Assurance** – enforces standards  
3. **Monitoring & Observability** – detects issues early  
4. **Continuous Testing** – validates every change

## 🏭 Traditional Software Delivery (Pre-DevOps)

| Role | Responsibility | Workflow |
|----|---------------|---------|
| Developer | Writes & commits code | Code → Repo |
| System Administrator | Provisions servers | Server creation |
| Build & Release Engineer | Deploys builds | Deploy → Promote |
| Tester | Validates application | Test → Feedback |

**Result:**  
- Multiple hand-offs  
- Manual processes  
- Long delivery cycles  
- End-to-end time ≈ **10 days**

## 📚 Core Pillars of DevOps

| Pillar | Description |
|------|------------|
| ⚙️ Automation | Provisioning, deployments, rollbacks |
| 🧪 Quality | Code reviews, static analysis, tests |
| 📊 Monitoring | Metrics, logs, alerts |
| 🔁 Continuous Testing | Unit, integration, performance tests |

> These pillars enable **Continuous Delivery / Continuous Deployment**.
